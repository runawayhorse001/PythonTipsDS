.. admonition:: Chinese proverb

	Be mindful of guarding against harm from others, and stay away from placing harming upon others.

If you are a real Data Scientist, you have to share your code with your colleagues or release your code for Code Review or Quality assurance(QA). You will definitely do not want to have your ``User Information`` in the code. So you can save them in login.txt:

.. code-block:: rst

	runawayhorse001
	PythonTips

and use the following code to import your ``User Information``:

.. code-block:: python

	#User Information
	try: 
	    login = pd.read_csv(r'login.txt', header=None)
	    user = login[0][0]
	    pw = login[0][1]
	    print('User information is ready!')
	except:
	    print('Login information is not available!!!')
