.. |nb| replace:: ``Jupyter Notebook``
.. |zp| replace:: ``Zeppelin``
.. |py| replace:: ``Python``
.. |nt| replace:: ``Nteract``

.. note::

    This Chapter :ref:`nb` is for beginner.  If you have alreay know
    |nt|, |zp| and |py|, you may skip this chapter.

If you are a Data Scientist, it's not enough to just know |nb|. You should
also take a look at ``nbviewer``, |nt| and |zp| notebooks.


Nteract
+++++++

|nt| is an amazing ``.ipynb`` reader. You can open and run the ``.ipynb`` by
just double clicking the ``.ipynb`` file.

Jupyter Notebook Viewer
+++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are a MAC user, you can also install the Jupyter Notebook Viewer
--``nbviewer-app`` which is much faster than |nt|.

Jupyter Notebook
++++++++++++++++

The |nb| (Ipython Notebook) is an open-source web application that allows you
to create and share documents that contain ``live code``, ``equations``,
``visualizations`` and ``narrative text``. Uses include: data cleaning and
transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization,
machine learning, and much more.
