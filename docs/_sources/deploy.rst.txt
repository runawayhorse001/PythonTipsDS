Model Deployment with Flask
===========================

In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to deployment your model with ``flask``. The main idea and code (I made some essential modification to make it work for Python 3) are from the Git repo:https://github.com/llSourcell/how_to_deploy_a_keras_model_to_production. So the copyright belongs to the original author. 

Install ``flask``
+++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install Flask

Train and Save your model 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can use the following code to train and save your ``CNN`` model:

.. code-block:: python

	#python 2/3 compatibility
	from __future__ import print_function
	#simplified interface for building models 
	import keras
	#our handwritten character labeled dataset
	from keras.datasets import mnist
	#because our models are simple
	from keras.models import Sequential
	#dense means fully connected layers, dropout is a technique to improve convergence, flatten to reshape our matrices for feeding
	#into respective layers
	from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
	#for convolution (images) and pooling is a technique to help choose the most relevant features in an image
	from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D
	from keras import backend as K


	#mini batch gradient descent ftw
	batch_size = 128
	#10 difference characters
	num_classes = 10
	#very short training time
	epochs = 12

	#input image dimensions
	#28x28 pixel images. 
	img_rows, img_cols = 28, 28

	#the data downloaded, shuffled and split between train and test sets
	#if only all datasets were this easy to import and format
	(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

	#this assumes our data format
	#For 3D data, "channels_last" assumes (conv_dim1, conv_dim2, conv_dim3, channels) while 
	#"channels_first" assumes (channels, conv_dim1, conv_dim2, conv_dim3).
	if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_first':
	    x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 1, img_rows, img_cols)
	    x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 1, img_rows, img_cols)
	    input_shape = (1, img_rows, img_cols)
	else:
	    x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
	    x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], img_rows, img_cols, 1)
	    input_shape = (img_rows, img_cols, 1)

	#more reshaping
	x_train = x_train.astype('float32')
	x_test = x_test.astype('float32')
	x_train /= 255
	x_test /= 255
	print('x_train shape:', x_train.shape)
	print(x_train.shape[0], 'train samples')
	print(x_test.shape[0], 'test samples')

	#convert class vectors to binary class matrices
	y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes)
	y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes)

	#build our model
	model = Sequential()
	#convolutional layer with rectified linear unit activation
	model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),
	                 activation='relu',
	                 input_shape=input_shape))
	#again
	model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
	#choose the best features via pooling
	model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
	#randomly turn neurons on and off to improve convergence
	model.add(Dropout(0.25))
	#flatten since too many dimensions, we only want a classification output
	model.add(Flatten())
	#fully connected to get all relevant data
	model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
	#one more dropout for convergence' sake :) 
	model.add(Dropout(0.5))
	#output a softmax to squash the matrix into output probabilities
	model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
	#Adaptive learning rate (adaDelta) is a popular form of gradient descent rivaled only by adam and adagrad
	#categorical ce since we have multiple classes (10) 
	model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,
	              optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),
	              metrics=['accuracy'])

	#train
	model.fit(x_train, y_train,
	          batch_size=batch_size,
	          epochs=epochs,
	          verbose=1,
	          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
	 #how well did it do? 
	score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
	print('Test loss:', score[0])
	print('Test accuracy:', score[1])

	#Save the model
	# serialize model to JSON
	model_json = model.to_json()
	with open("model.json", "w") as json_file:
	    json_file.write(model_json)
	# serialize weights to HDF5
	model.save_weights("model.h5")
	print("Saved model to disk")
