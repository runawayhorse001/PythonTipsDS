Python Installation
===================

.. |py| replace:: ``Python``

.. note::

	This Chapter :ref:`install` is for beginner.  If you have some |py| programming experience, you may skip this chapter. 


No matter what operator system is, I will strongly recommend you to install ``Anaconda`` which contains |py|, ``Jupyter``, ``spyder``, ``Numpy``, ``Scipy``, ``Numba``, ``pandas``, ``DASK``,
``Bokeh``, ``HoloViews``, ``Datashader``, ``matplotlib``, ``scikit-learn``, ``H2O.ai``, ``TensorFlow``, ``CONDA`` and more.
