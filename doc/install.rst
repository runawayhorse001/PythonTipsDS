==================
Python Environment
==================


.. |py| replace:: ``Python``

.. note::

    This Chapter :ref:`install` is for beginner.  If you have some |py|
    programming experience, you may skip this chapter. For beginners, you
    can choose the hard-core way, installing and setting up python in your
    own computer. Alternatively, there is easy route to leverage free online
    data science environment that requires zero setup.


Use python on local computer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No matter what operator system is, I will strongly recommend you to install
``Anaconda`` which contains |py|, ``Jupyter``, ``spyder``, ``Numpy``,
``Scipy``, ``Numba``, ``pandas``, ``DASK``, ``Bokeh``, ``HoloViews``,
``Datashader``, ``matplotlib``, ``scikit-learn``, ``H2O.ai``, ``TensorFlow``,
``CONDA`` and more.

Use python on the cloud (zero setup)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Learning a new programming language is not easy.
Luckily, nowadays there are many web-based data science environment available
that allows one to learn python without downloading or installing python in
local laptop, you can do almost anything online, including free access to GPUs!

Google Colab (FREE)
-------------------
Quote from the official introduction on Google,
Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, is a free Jupyter notebook environment
that requires no setup, and runs entirely (writing, running, & sharing code)
within Google Drive.

* Zero configuration/setup required on your own machine!
* Free access to GPUs and TPUs: code execute on Google's cloud servers
* Search and use built-in code snippets
* Easy sharing (like Google doc)

Kaggle Kernels (FREE)
---------------------
Kaggle is best known as a platform for data science competitions.
They also provide a free service called Kernels that can be used independently
of their competitions.
