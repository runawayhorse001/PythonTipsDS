About this note
---------------

This document is a summary of our valueable experiences in using |py| 
for |ds| daily work. The PDF version can be downloaded from `HERE <sphinxgithub.pdf>`_. 

**You may download and distribute it. Please be aware, however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or incorrect description.** 

In this repository, we try to use the detailed |ds| related demo code and 
examples to share some useful python tips for Data Scientist work. If you 
find your work wasn’t cited in this note, please feel free to let me know.

Although we are by no means a python programming and Data Scientist expert, 
We decided that it would be useful for us to share what we learned 
about Python in the form of easy note with detailed example. 
We hope those notes will be a valuable tool for your studies.

The notes assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of ``python`` programing, ``LaTex`` and ``Linux``. And this document is generated automatically by using `sphinx`_. More details can be found at [Georg2018]_.

Motivation for this note
++++++++++++++++++++++++


No matter you like it or not, Python has been one of the most popular programming languages.
I have been using |py| for almost 4 years. Frankly speaking, I wasn't impressed and attracted 
by |py| at the first using. After starting working in industry, I have to use |py|. Gradually
I recognize the elegance of Python and use it as one of my main programming language. But I found that:

* Most of the |py| books or tutorials which emphasize on programming will overwhelm the green hand.
* While most of the |py| books or tutorials for |ds| or |da| didn't cover some essential skills
  from the engineer side.

So I want to keep some of my valuable tips which are heavily applied in my daily work.
